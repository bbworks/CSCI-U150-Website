          width="30%">Hi! My name is Bradley Fred Biera, and I was born
        in Edison, New Jersey on March 10, 1995. I have an older
        half-sister, an older sister, and a one minute-younger twin
        brother. I've moved three times in my life: from Edison, New
        Jersey to Liberty, South Carolina; From Liberty, South Carolina
        to Fountain Inn, South Carolina; and from Fountain Inn, South
        Carolina, to Simpsonville, South Carolina. I have three pet
        cockatiels as pets (named Junior, Georgy, and Little Birdy). My
        hobbies include guitar, piano, drums, ukulele, bass, listening
        to music, writing/composing music, drawing, building, playing
        video games, making jokes, hanging out with friends, and
        watching movies. I currently attend University of South Carolina
        Upstate as part of Class of 2017. My major is Computer
        Information Systems and in the future I hope to work somewhere
        in the computer field and to make music on the side, which
        includes on my YouTube channel: <a
